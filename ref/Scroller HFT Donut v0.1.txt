ALRIGHT, IT'S ABOUT TIME TO MAKE THESE FINGERS BLEED...  BUT FIRST, PARTY ORGANIZERS, THIS PART IS JUST THE DOUGHNUT. SO CHECK OUT THE MUSIC, AND THAT'S PROBABLY ENOUGH.  YOU CAN LET THE SCROLLER RUN, BUT YOU BETTER MAKE SURE THIS IS THE LAST DEMO OF THE COMPO, BECAUSE I PLAN TO GO ON FOR A WHILE.    YES, HAMMERFIST/DESIRE ON THE KEYS, WHICH SHOULD BE ENOUGH OF A WARNING.  

QUICK INTERMISSION FOR KIERAN:  ....

ALRIGHT, IT'S HAMMERFIST AGAIN.   SHOUT OUT TO ALIEN^PDX, JADE, AND SPKR, FOR THE INSPIRATION FOR THE LOGO.   THE FONT IS A PIMPED UP VERSION OF MY ORIGINAL, MADE FOR 1991 DONUT IN 2013.   I FEEL THIS DONUT IS BECOMING A BIT OF A MEME, AND I AM HERE FOR IT!     I GUESS THE BIGGEST TRICK FOR THE LOGO WAS KEEPING IT 16 COLORS, AND I AM VERY PLEASED HOW IT TURNED OUT.     THIS WHOLE MEGADEMO PRODUCTION WAS A NICE EXPERIENCE FOR ME.  LOTS OF EXCELLENT CODERS WHO GAVE ME ROOM TO SUGGEST ALL SORTS OF IDEAS FOR THE DESIGN, AND TRUSTED ME TO DELIVER.   REALLY A PLEASANT WAY TO WORK I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR!    I FEEL I SHOULD STRESS, THOUGH, THAT I AM NOT THE MAIN DESIGNER OR ANYTHING.  THE OVERALL THEME WAS SET, AND MY INPUT WAS OFFERING SUGGESTION FOR THE SMALL STUFF. DETAILS LIKE THE LOOK OF THE ICONS, CERTAIN CHOICES LIKE THE "WARNING, SPEED BUMP" ICON FOR THE CREDITS PART, WHICH IS ALL BUMP MAPPING, STUFF LIKE THAT.   AND EVEN WITHOUT THAT, I WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY IF ONLY THEY'D PUT UP WITH MY ENDLESS BRAINSTORMS AND ALL MY (REPEATED) QUESTIONS ABOUT GRAPHICS RESTRICTIONS.    I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW THE ARCHIMEDES WAS EVEN A THING UNTIL I WORKED ON FATHOM LAST YEAR, AND MY AMIGA AND C64 BACKGROUND DIDN'T NECESSARILY HELP EITHER.     SO, TODAY IS SUNDAY, JUNE 1ST 2025, AND I SPENT THE MORNING WITH MY FAMILY AT A SORT OF STREET FAIR. THE NEIGHBOURHOOD MY NIECES LIVE IN WAS ORGANIZING IT. LOTS OF PEOPLE IN FRONT OF THEIR HOMES TO SELL ALL SORTS OF KNICKNACKS, OLD CLOTHES AND TOYS, OLD BOOKS, MAYBE VINYL OR ACTUAL COLLECTIBLES AND TOO MANY YOUNG KIDS SELLING CUPCAKES, LEMONADE, OR ACTING LIKE STREET PERFORMERS.   ALL VERY ADORABLE, AND THE WEATHER WAS GREAT.   THE AFTERNOON WAS MOSTLY PLAYING INDOORS WITH PLAYMOBIL.  I LET MY KIDS PLAY TOO, DON'T WORRY!    NOW IT'S EVENING, AND THEY ARE ASLEEP.   SO I'M GRABBING MY CHANCE TO TYPE SOMETHING FOR MY PERSONAL ENTERTAINMENT.  AND TO ANNOY ALL THOSE HEROES THAT CAPTURE THESE DEMOS FOR YOUTUBE.   BECAUSE LETTING THIS RUN ALL THE WAY TO THE END IS GOING TO REQUIRE SOME PATIENCE.  AND THIS ISN'T THE ONLY SCROLLER I WAS ALLOWED TO FILL, SO BUCKLE UP, LADS AND LADIES!    -- TIME JUMP -- IT'S EVENING NOW, STILL SUNDAY THOUGH.  I AM GOING TO SAVE THIS AND TYPE MORE LATER THIS WEEK. I STILL NEED TO FINISH AN ANIMATION FOR A DISCO BALL.  LET'S SEE IF THAT WILL MAKE THE CUT, AS I'M NOT NEARLY AS PLEASED WITH THOSE GRAPHICS AS I AM WITH OTHER STUFF I DID.   BUT MAYBE I CAN FIGURE IT OUT IN TIME AND MAKE IT LOOK GOOD... GO CHECK OUT THAT PART, BUT KNOW YOU'LL HAVE TO REREAD ALL OF THIS IF YOU QUIT NOW.    HEHE, THERE'S A NICE LITTLE DILEMMA.   NOTHING TOO GRAND ON A COSMIC SCALE, BUT WHAT WILL YOU DO IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOCAP PART YET?  GO THERE NOW, AND HOPE TO RETURN TO THIS FOR THE REST OF MY SCROLLER?  OR EVEN HOPE THIS IS NEARING THE END ALREADY?   OR STAY HERE UNTIL I'M DONE WITH MY RAMBLINGS - NOT KNOWING HOW MUCH MORE TIME IT WILL BE?    HM, UNLESS BETWEEN NOW AND NOVA PARTY, WE INCLUDE SOME KIND OF INFO ON THE LENGTH OF THIS, OR BETTER YET, WE INCLUDE A WAY FOR THE DEMO TO KEEP TRACK OF HOW FAR YOU GOT WITH THE SCROLLER, AND WE START THERE WHEN YOU OPEN A PART AGAIN...   YES. I SHOULD DEFINITELY ASK OUR CODERS IF THAT'S AN OPTION.  I'LL GO DO THAT NOW, AND CONTINUE THIS LATER.  OOH, I LOVE THIS PERSPECTIVE DIFFERENCE.  I WON'T KNOW THE RESULT UNTIL AFTER THEY REPLY.  AND YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW LATER THAN ME, BUT FOR YOU THE TIME PASSING BETWEEN WHEN YOU FIRST LEARN OF THIS, AND ME SHOWING THE ANSWER A FEW CHARACTERS FURTHER DOWN THE SCROLLER IS ACTUALLY NOT THAT LONG..   BUT IF IT IS. WE REALLY OUGHT TO HAVE SPED UP THIS SCROLLER. SORRY ABOUT THAT!   ANYWAY...  FOR NOW, SOME TIME PASSED BY FOR ME - IT'S THE 6TH OF JUNE NOW, FRIDAY EVENING - AND I FOUND SOME TIME AGAIN TO WRITE MORE USELESS BANTER.  I AM RUNNING ON MORPHINE ATM - THE DOCTOR THINKS IT MAY BE A HERNIA, AND ALL I KNOW IS IT FEELS LIKE A NERVE BEING PINCHED AND THE PAIN RADIATING FROM MY LOWER BACK TO MY LEG, SO YEAH... IT'S DEFINITELY AGE RELATED.   NOT THAT I AM -THAT- OLD YET, AT 48, BUT YOU KNOW, I AM NOT AS SPRY AS BACK IN YE OL' COMP-JOOTER DAYS.  OR WHATEVER. I'M ON DRUGS, REMEMBER?  CUT ME SOME SLACK. OR SOME PIE.   WHO DOESN'T LIKE GOOD PIE.   AND BEFORE YOU THINK THE DRUGS MAKE ME A RAMBLING MESS, YOU CLEARLY DON'T KNOW ME THAT WELL. I AM ALWAYS A RAMBLING MESS. I DO NOT NEED DRUGS TO DO THAT FOR ME, HA!     RIGHT, TELL YOU WHAT. I HAVE MORE STUFF TO DO, YOU HAVE MORE STUFF TO DO, LET'S CALL THIS A NIGHT.  I WILL SAVE THE REST OF MY AMMO FOR ANOTHER PART OF THIS MEGA DEMO.  PROBABLY THE MAIN MENU, POSSIBLY THE VECTORBALLS PART.  IT'S NOT THAT I THINK EVERY PART NEEDS MY INPUT, IT'S JUST THAT APPARENTLY NOBODY ELSE LIKES TO WRITE SCROLLERS THAT MUCH - BUT THEY ARE SUCH A DEMOSCENE STAPLE, I WAS ABLE TO CONVINCE THEM TO ADD A COUPLE....  BY PROMISING I WOULD FILL THEM MYSELF, SO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO, HEHE....   SO THERE. YOU READ IT HERE FIRST. HAMMERFIST RAMBLES FOR FUN.   OK, SIGNING OFF, SCROLLER WILL PROBABLY RESTART. MAYBE WE'LL ERASE YOUR HARD DRIVE. LET'S FIND OUT TOGETHER!  THANKS FOR STICKING AROUND, YOU HAVE MY EVERLASTING GRATITUDE!  -X-
