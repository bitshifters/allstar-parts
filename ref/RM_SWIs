RasterMan v0.37, 22nd May 2025               (c) Stephen Harrison, 2014-2025
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

New in v0.37 - officially allocated SWI base and error block!

NOTE: With the change to new SWI base, SWI RasterMan_QTMParamAddr has been
removed. Its function is now fully covered by the new SWI RasterMan_Status,
but this is not a drop-in replacement. So if you are updating your code for
the new SWI base and for some reason you used the old (very limited use)
QTMParamAddr SWI, check out the new Status SWI and update to use this.

Additional v0.37 - SWI RasterMan_Release now causes RasterMan to 'forget' any
VIDC and MEMC tables, and any CallBack address. So you must set up your VIDC
and MEMC tables again with SWI RasterMan_SetTables, if you intend to call SWI
RasterMan_Install again. This minimises risk of 'old' addresses remaining in
RasterMan's memory if/when another user calls RM.

RasterMan works on *REAL* Acorn Archimedes computers upto RISC OS 3.1x It
will also run under emulation on Arculator v2.1 and later.

Introduction
------------

RasterMan brings 100% accurate H-Sync 'raster bar' interrupts to the
Archimedes, which (amongst other things) allows the user to: create solid
raster bars, switch display resolutions mid-screen, change the entire
16-register palette on every scanline, mirror sections of the screen, etc.
All this is possible while music can still be played using QTM (special
release), due to accurate scheduling of QTM's interrupts so they do not clash
with RasterMan's H-Sync interrupts.

This version of RasterMan allow 0/4/8 or 16 VIDC register changes and 0, 1 or
2 MEMC register changes, up to twice per scanline, or once every x scanlines
(x=1 to 255). Programming of registers is carried out through (up to) 4
user-defined register tables which can be moified in real time. Note:
Reducing the number of register changes and/or increasing the number of
scanlines between RasterMan 'HSync' interruptes will reduce the amount of CPU
usage by RasterMan's HSync interrupt, so to free up CPU time, only use the
number of changes you need.

The RasterMan HSync interrupt is timed to occur between the end of the
previous scanline, during H-retrace, and the start of the target scanline, so
that any changes to VIDC palette and screen parameters, and MEMC registers
will be in place by the start of the target scanline. If configured for two
changes per scanline, the second change is timed to occur approximately half
way through the scanline output, so palette changes will be visible unless
carefully aligned to changing screen data.

Example use of RasterMan: When set to have 16 VIDC changes per line taking
place, RasterMan enables the programmer to accurately change the entire 16
register VIDC palette *on every scanline*, with no flicker or visible
artefacts, allowing colourful "raster bar" effects.


More than 16 changes per line?
------------------------------

By allowing two interrupts per scanline (RasterMan_Confgure, with R2=0), the
first RasterMan interrupt occure during H-retrace (as above), and the second
at approx. half-way through the displayed scanline.
 
Changing up to 32 VIDC and up to 4 MEMC registers each scanline involves RM
using a lot of processor time particularly on Arm2 systems, so this may only
be of use in very carefully crafted demo/game scenes.

Note: As the second 16 VIDC registers are being changed mid-scanline, palette
changes may be visible immediately on the screen, so programmers will need to
select colours and graphics carefully to avoid the user seeing any jitter
(the pixel timing of the mid-scanline changes is affected by unavoidable
sound and video DMA requests, so expect +/- 4 pixel accuracy if making
mid-scanline palette changes).

SWI documentation v0.37
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

RasterMan v0.37 now has an offical RISC OS registered SWI base. This change
since v0.36 means users moving their code to v0.37 will need to reassemble
any existing ARM code that relied on the previous SWI numbers.

Allocated SWI base: &5A940


SWI RasterMan_Install                                                 &5A900
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry: -
Exit:  RasterMan enabled. All interrupts disabled except RasterMan and QTM.

This SWI enables RasterMan HSync interrupt code on the IRQ and FIQ vectors.
Once enabled, RasterMan will read registers from the VIDC and MEMC tables on
each raster interrupt and pass these to the VIDC and MEMC. In order to
guarentee solid 'rasters', all RISC OS interrupts are disabled. This means
code must not call any OS SWIs which rely on interrupts or are not IRQ
compatible (eg. SWIs to read the 100Hz timer, set up interrupts, etc.).

With RasterMan enabled, BASIC will still run, but programmes must not use the
TIME variable, or the WAIT or MODE commands, or any key/input commands. Use
SWI RasterMan_Release to disable RasterMan's HSync interrupt.

***************************************************************************
** Also you must not LOAD/SAVE any data - disc access must not take place**
** while RM HSync is active, or the system will crash, disable RM first! **
***************************************************************************

When RasterMan is enabled, the RasterMan SWIs are safe to use and should be
used in preferance to any OS SWIs.

An error will be generated, and RasterMan will not be enabled, if the VIDC or
MEMC tables have not been defined using SWI RasterMan_SetTables.


SWI RasterMan_Release                                                 &5A901
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry: -
Exit:  RasterMan disabled. All interrupts including OS interrupts reenabled.

This SWI releases RasterMan control of IRQ and FIQ vectors and disables the
RasterMan HSync interrupt code. You must call this SWI once your code has
finished using RasterMan and wishes to return control of interrupts to the
OS.

From v0.37, SWI RasterMan_Release also causes RasterMan to 'forget' and VIDC
and MEMC tables, and any CallBack address. So you must set up your VIDC and
MEMC tables again with SWI RasterMan_SetTables, if you intend to call SWI
RasterMan_Install again. This minimises risk of 'old' addresses remaining in
RasterMan's memory if/when another user calls RM.

Remember: You must call this SWI if your code wants to load any data from
disc, or use any OS SWI which is not IRQ compatible.


SWI RasterMan_Wait                                                    &5A902
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry: -
Exit:  all registers preserved

This SWI waits until the end of the vertical screen redraw, then returns to
the caller once the VIDC is in V-retrace. During the retrace, the screenbanks
can be swapped or screen data updated/sprites plotted without causing visual
artifacts/tearing.

This SWI performs the same function as OS_Byte 19 and may be called when
RasterMan is initialised as well as when it is not.

(Note: You must not call OS_Byte 19 when RM is initialised because calling
this OS SWI will crash the computer, use SWI RasterMan_Wait instead).


SWI RasterMan_SetTables                                               &5A903
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry: R0=vidc table 1 [4/8/16 regs per interrupt], or -1 to read current
       R1=vidc table 2 [8/16 regs per interrupt], or -1 to read current
       R2=vidc table 3 [16 regs per interrupt], or -1 to read current
       R3=memc table [1 or 2 regs per interrupt], or -1 to read current

Exit:  R0-R3 previous table pointers

This SWI must be called before initialising RasterMan, as it specifies the
memory address of the VIDC tables and MEMC table of registers to update
during each reaster interrupt. ***WARNING: The user must define all the
tables needed by the configuration (SWI RasterMan_Configure) before RM is
initialised, or the system will hang on initialisation***.

*** Note: The size/format of these tables may change in future versions ***

The format of the tables is as follows:

VIDC table 1 (required for 4/8/16 changes) & VIDC table 2 (8/16 changes)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

VIDC tables 1 and 2 have 4 words per raster. Each word is a VIDC register
parameter (eg. a palette register) which is sent to the VIDC during HSync
interrupt for the corresponding raster. The minumum size of table 1 and table
2 is <number of scanline interrupts>*16 bytes, so for 256 scanlines with 1
interrupt every scanline, the table size must be at least 256*16 = 4096
bytes. Tables 1 and 2 are formatted as follows:

Raster   0: Word    0, Word    1, Word    2, Word    3
Raster   1: Word    4, Word    5, Word    6, Word    7
...
Raster 255: Word 1020, Word 1021, Word 1022, Word 1023

IMPORTANT: Every word in this table will be sent to the VIDC, so be very
careful about prefilling the table. If you fill the table with 0's, this will
set colour 0 to rgb=000 ie. black, on each raster. So do not prefill with 0's
unless you want colour 0 programmed to black on each unused line. If your
game/demo is not using the border colour, then a good option is to prefill
with &40000000, which sets the border to black.

VIDC table 3 (only needed for 16 changes per scanline)
------------------------------------------------------

VIDC table 3 is larger than tables 1 or 2, because table 3 contains 8
registers/words per raster. The minumum size of table 3 is <number of
scanline interrupts>*32 bytes, so for 256 scanlines with 1 interrupt every
scanline, the table size must be at least 256*32 = 8192 bytes. Table 3 is
formatted as follows:

Raster   0: Words    0,    1,    2,    3,    4,    5,    6,    7
Raster   1: Words    8,    9,   10,   11,   12,   13,   14,   15
...
Raster 255: Words 2040, 2041, 2042, 2043, 2044, 2045, 2046, 2047

As with tables 1 and 2, be careful when pre-filling the table as all words
are sent to the VIDC.

MEMC table
----------

The MEMC table is either 1 or 2 words per raster depending on whether there
are 1 or 2 MEMC changes configured per RasterMan interrupt. As with the VIDC
table, these 1 or 2 words are registers which are sent to the MEMC on each
interrupt. However, unlike the VIDC tables, the words in the MEMC table are
only sent to the MEMC if their value is >= &03600000, as this is required for
MEMC registers. Because of this check, you can safely prefill the MEMC table
with 0's, these will not be sent to the MEMC.

The minumum size of the MEMC table is <number of MEMC changes per
interrupt>*<number of scanline interrpts>*4 bytes, so for 2 MEMC changes per
interrupt, 256 scanlines with 1 interrupt every scanline, the table size must
be at least 256*8 = 2048 bytes. The MEMC tables is formatted as follows:

1 MEMC change per interrupt:

Raster   0: Word    0
Raster   1: Word    1
...
Raster 255: Word  255

2 MEMC changes per interrupt:

Raster   0: Word    0, Word    1
Raster   1: Word    2, Word    3
...
Raster 255: Word  510, Word  511


SWI RasterMan_Version                                                 &5A904
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry: -
Exit:  R0=version*100 (eg. 011 for v0.11)

Used to read the version of RasterMan loaded.


SWI RasterMan_ReadScanline                                            &5A905
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry: -
Exit:  R0=current scanline (0-max screen height) 
          or -1 if V-retrace taking place

This SWI is a useful alternative to RasterMan_Wait and returns either the
current on-screen scanline being sent to the display, or returns -1 if the
display is in V-retrace.

This SWI only works when RasterMan is installed and will return an error if
RasterMan H-Sync interrupts are not enabled (see SWI RasterMan_Install).


SWI RasterMan_SetVIDCRegister                                         &5A906
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry: R0=VIDC register to send to VIDC
Exit:  registers preserved

This SWI sends the contents of R0 direct to the VIDC.

The user must be careful to ensure R0 contains a valid VIDC
register/parameter, as no checks are preformed by this SWI and sending an
invalid register to the VIDC could result in an immediate complete system
crash.


SWI RasterMan_SetMEMCRegister                                         &5A907
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry: R0=MEMC register to send to MEMC
Exit:  registers preserved

This SWI sends the contents of R0 direct to the MEMC.

The user must be very careful to ensure R0 contains a valid MEMC
register/parameter, as no checks are preformed by this SWI and sending an
invalid register to the MEMC will almost certainly result in an immediate
complete system crash.


SWI RasterMan_Status                                                  &5A908
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**NOTE this SWI has changed since v0.36 and is not backwards compatible**

Entry: -
Exit:  R0=RasterMan status byte:
		bit	meaning if set
		0	RasterMan installed and running
		1	RasterMan is controlling QTM music and DMA IRQs
			(bit1 is only valid if bit0=1 RasterMan installed)
		2	User callback enabled

If bit0 of R0 is set, RasterMan H-interrupt code is installed and functioning
correctly. If bit1 is set, then RM is communicating with QTM correctly to
enable sound, by handling all music IRQs and DMA fill IRQs. If bit2 is set,
an external routine (registered with RasterMan_CallBack) will be called after
all VSync processing (including music/DMA IRQs).


SWI RasterMan_ScanKeyboard                                            &5A909
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry: -
Exit:  R0=two byte keyboard code

This SWI reads the curent two-byte keyboard key code.


SWI RasterMan_ClearKeyBuffer (temp SWI, may be removed in future)     &5A90A
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry: -
Exit:  -

This SWI clears the current RM keyboard buffer.


SWI RasterMan_ReadScanAddr                                            &5A90B
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry: -
Exit:  R0=address of 'swi_scankeyboard' routine

This SWI returns the address of the scan keyboard routine - so this can be
called directly, avoiding the need to call the SWI as the OS SWI routines may
disable interrupts briefly.


SWI RasterMan_HSyncWaitAddr                                           &5A90C
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry: -
Exit:  R0=address of code to call for HSync Wait (R5 & R6 will be corrupted
on calling)

Returns address of short code routine that can be called directly to wait for
completion of next RM interrupt (equivalent of HSync, if one int per line).

Note: if the routine at R0 is called from USR mode, it will only work if RM
configured for >4 VIDC changes per line, otherwise it will hang until reset!
Calling from SVC or IRQ mode will work for any RM setting.


SWI RasterMan_Configure                                               &5A90D
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry: R0=0, 4, 8, 16 VIDC register changes per H-interrupt, -1 to read
       R1=0, 1, 2 MEMC register changes per H-interrupt, -1 to read
       R2=number of scanlines between H-interrupts (min. = 1 to interrupt
every line, max. = 256, or set to 0 for 2 H-interrpts per line, one at start,
one in middle), -1 to read

...if both R0&R1=0 then no VIDC/MEMC changes or H-interrupts IRQs will happen

Exit:  R0, R1, R2 = settings before any changes made, all other reg preserved

This SWI configures RasterMan to the required number of VIDC/MEMC changes per
'HSync' interrupt and sets the number of scanlines between each interrupt.

Note - if changing configuration while RasterMan is 'installed' (SWI
RasterMan_Install), you must call RasterMan_Wait, followed by
RasterMan_SetTables (if necessary) to ensure the correct tables are
available, *before* making changes by calling RasterMan_Configure, otherwise
it will likely crash.

Default settup: R0=16 VIDC changes, R1=2 MEMC changes, R2=1 scanline per int


SWI RasterMan_Mode                                                    &5A90E
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry: R0=new screen mode number
Exit:  R0 preserved

This SWI changes mode. Don't use if RM is installed.


SWI RasterMan_CallBack                                                &5A90F
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry: R0=address of routine to be called once RM VSync processing is
complete, 0 to clear the callback, or -1 to read current callback addr.
Exit:  R0=previous address or 0 if not in use

The callback routine will be called with processor in IRQ mode and IRQs
disabled. On entry R13 points to IRQ stack, R14 contains return address+4.
The routine must complete quickly, preserve all registers, and exit with SUBS
PC,R14,#4. The routine must not call any SWIs, or enable IRQs, as this will
crash RM.


SWI RasterMan_ReadSWIHandler                                          &5A910
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry: -
Exit:  R0=address of RM SWI handler code

This returns the address of RM's SWI handler code, so you can call directly
from your code, or from IRQs to save time.

To use the address returned by R0, you must only call it from SVC or IRQ
mode, and you must set R11 = <required SWI number>-<RM SWI base> (or use the
final 2 digits of the number shown to the right of each SWI in this ReadMe).
eg. to call RasterMan_Version, set R11=&04.

Some RM SWIs must never be called from within an interrupt or callback:
Install, Release, Wait, Configure and Mode, or will lead to system hang.
Others should be OK, if used appropriately (eg. don't call the HSync wait
code returned by HSyncWaitAddr if you are in a VSync callback...).
